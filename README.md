Cleaned date columns & extracted month names

Grouped data by product, ticket status, priority & channel

Generated statistical summaries

Created visualizations (bar, pie, line charts)

2. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Added KPIs (Total Tickets, Avg Satisfaction, Product Count, etc.)

Designed charts for ticket priority, status trends, product issues

Built a matrix for channel-wise priority distribution

Visualized monthly product purchases

 Key Insights
 Ticket Trends

Total Tickets: 8,469

Average Satisfaction Rating: 2.99

Most tickets generated in: January, April, October

✔ Customer Demographics

Balanced gender distribution

Average age: 44.03 years

✔ Top Support Issues

Refund requests

Hardware failures

✔ Priority & Satisfaction

High-priority tickets strongly correlate with lower satisfaction.

✔ Support Channels

Email & chat channels receive the highest number of tickets.

 Correlation Insights

Priority ↑ → Satisfaction ↓ (High-priority issues generate more dissatisfaction)

Product complexity ↑ → Ticket volume ↑

Seasonal spikes appear in months related to holidays and sale seasons.

Social media shows a surprising number of critical cases — customers escalate issues publicly.
